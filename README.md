# Chinook-sql
The project aims at exploring the The Chinook Database which holds information about a music store. Four SQL queries were written to answer some questions and help understand the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. Eventually, the outcomes were visualized in Python to describe the findings behind each question.
